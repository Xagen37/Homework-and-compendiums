Just another repository.<br>
It contains my homework and a bit more.<br>

They must have been already closed, so I hope it won't be considered cheating.<br>

[Discret math](labs/DMLabs)<br>
[Linear algebra](labs/LinAlLabs)<br>
[Math logic](https://github.com/Xagen37/Projects/tree/master/proof_rebuilder)
