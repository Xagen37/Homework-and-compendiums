# Labs
I decided to add my labs here too.<br>
They must have been already closed, so I hope it won't be considered cheating.<br>
[Algorithms and data structures](labs/AlgoLabs)<br>
[Discret math](labs/DMLabs)<br>
[Linear algebra](labs/LinAlLabs)

# Compendiums
I don't know how is it said in English, but here it is.<br>
[Computer architecture](compendiums/Computer_architecture.pdf).<br>
[The same, but with pearlies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lAgR7urtgu8xBsn-nue1H9uq4h6_gtPxQ5rW5eTOk28/edit?usp=sharing)


# Programming-homework

Just another repository.<br>
It contains my homework.<br>
Hope I won't give it up as I did many times ago.<br>
P.S.: 8th homework is not missed. It just doesn't exist.<br>
